  Veteran-facing Services Platform (VSP) The <code>va.gov-team</code> repository is used for documentation created and
  used by the
</h1>
<p>
  teams that build and use the VSP. The information in this repo is relevant to teams building Veteran-facing services,
  teams running the platform itself, DSVA (Digital Service at VA), DEPO (Digital Experience Product Office) team
  members, and VA stakeholders. This repo is open and viewable by the public. ### What is the VSP? The Veteran-facing
  Services Platform (VSP) is the common infrastructure, technical and non-technical components, and processes that
  support static and interactive content consumed by Veterans via VA.gov. Major pieces of the VSP include a set of APIs
  that manage communication between a Veteran user and internal VA resources, an identity and authentication system, a
  design system based on the U.S. Web Design System, reusable frontend components, a Drupal-based content management
  system, and an extensive set of documentation and guides. ## Get in touch To request support from the VSP team, drop
  us a line in Slack at <a href="https://dsva.slack.com/messages/CBU0KDSB1"><code>#vfs-platform-support</code></a
